## Overview

The Credential Manager is a native Android component that allows developers the ability for their users to easily authenticate themselves using...

1. Email and Password
2. Passkeys
3. Google Account Login
4. Custom Third Party&#x20;

It appears as a bottom card during your user's authentication flow by either the user clicking on a button (Manual Triggering) or you calling the package for the user when they enter a page (Implicit Calling).

{% hint style="warning" %}
This package only provides support for the above features on Android. If you want a cross-platform implementation stay tuned for the release of our Expo-OneAuth Package with support for more authentication methods across all platforms.
